# OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
# Python is an object-oriented language, allowing you to structure your code using classes and objects for better organization and reusability.

# Advantages of OOP
# --- Provides a clear structure to programs
# ---Makes code easier to maintain, reuse, and debug
# ---Helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
# --- Allows you to build reusable applications with less code


# Classes and objects are the two core concepts in object-oriented programming.
# Class	 --->  Fruit ,                  Car	
# Objects ---> Apple, Banana, Mango 	Volvo, Audi, Toyota


# When you create an object from a class, it inherits all the variables and functions defined inside that class.
